# Wikibase DataModel Serialization

Library containing serializers and deserializers for the Wikibase DataModel.
The supported formats are limited to public ones, ie those used by a web API.
Serialization code for private formats, such as the format used by the Wikibase
Repo data access layer, belongs in other components.

## Installation

The recommended way to use this library is via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

### Composer

To add this package as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a
dependency on `wikibase/data-model-serialization` to your project's `composer.json` file.
Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on
version 1.0 of this package:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"wikibase/data-model-serialization": "1.0.*"
	}
}
```

### Manual

Get the code of this package, either via git, or some other means. Also get all dependencies.
You can find a list of the dependencies in the "require" section of the composer.json file.
Then take care of autoloading the classes defined in the src directory.

## Library usage

Construct an instance of the deserializer or serializer you need via the appropriate factory.

```php
use Wikibase\DataModel\DeserializerFactory;

$deserializerFactory = new DeserializerFactory( /* ... */ );
$entityDeserializer = $deserializerFactory->newEntityDeserializer();
```

The use the deserialize or serialize method.

```php
$entity = $entityDeserializer->deserialize( $myEntitySerialization );
```

In case of deserialization, guarding against failures is good practice.
So it is typically better to use the slightly more verbose try-catch approach.

```php
try {
	$entity = $entityDeserializer->deserialize( $myEntitySerialization );
}
catch ( DeserializationException $ex ) {
	// Handling of the exception
}
```

All access to services provided by this library should happen through the
SerializerFactory and DeserializerFactory. The rest of the code is an implementation
detail which users should not know about.

## Library structure

The Wikibase DataModel objects can all be serialized to a generic format from which the objects
can later be reconstructed. This is done via a set of Serializers/Serializer implementing objects.
These objects turn for instance a Claim object into a data structure containing only primitive
types and arrays. This data structure can thus be readily fed to json_encode, serialize, or the
like. The process of reconstructing the objects from such a serialization is provided by
objects implementing the Deserializers/Deserializer interface.

Serializers can be obtained via an instance of SerializerFactory and deserializers can be obtained
via an instance of DeserializerFactory. You are not allowed to construct these serializers and
deserializers directly yourself or to have any kind of knowledge of them (ie type hinting). These
objects are internal to this component and might change name or structure at any time. All you
are allowed to know when calling $serializerFactory->newEntitySerializer() is that you get back
an instance of Serializers\Serializer.

## Tests

This library comes with a set up PHPUnit tests that cover all non-trivial code. You can run these
tests using the PHPUnit configuration file found in the root directory.

    phpunit
    
By default the slow tests are not run. You can run them with

    phpunit --group slow

## Release notes

### 1.3.0 (dev)

* `FingerprintSerializer` now supports serializing `AliasGroupFallback`s and `TermFallback`s
* `EntityDeserializer` now fails if the given serialization contains a term or alias that was either
  the result of a fallback or transliteration
* Added `newTypedSnakSerializer` to `SerializerFactory`

### 1.2.0 (2014-10-15)

* Compatibility with DataModel 2.x added
* Support statements on properties
* Add option to serialize maps as objects instead of arrays so as to be able to
  differentiate empty maps from empty lists

### 1.1.1 (2014-09-09)

* Use UnDeserializable error from serialization in SnakDeserializer

### 1.1.0 (2014-09-02)

* Compatibility with DataModel 1.x was added
* DataModel 1.x is now required

### 1.0.3 (2014-07-28)

* Hashes are now ignored by the SnakDeserializer
* Compatibility with Wikibase DataModel 1.x was improved

### 1.0.2 (2014-07-21)

* Fixed issue where invalid snaks-order elements in reference serialization caused an error rather
 than a deserialization exception
* Hashes are now ignored by the ReferenceDeserializer

### 1.0.1 (2014-06-16)

* The Deserializer for snaks now constructs UnDeserializableValue objects for invalid data values

### 1.0 (2014-05-27)

* Usage of DataModel 0.7.x rather than 0.6.x.
* Usage of Serialization ~3.1 rather than ~2.1.
* Snaks now always have a 'hash' element in their serialization
* Added `snaks-order` support to `ReferenceSerializer` and `ReferenceDeserializer`
* Added `qualifiers-order` support to `ClaimDeserializer`
* Added `TypedSnakSerializer`
* Added hash validation for references and snaks
* Added additional tests to ensure old serializations can still be deserialized

### 0.1 (2014-02-22)

Initial release with these features:

* Serializers for the main Wikibase DataModel (0.6) objects
* Deserializers for the main Wikibase DataModel (0.6) objects
